Simple Pan allows you to "grab" the page with your middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel button) and move it around. This can be handy when navigating pages that are larger than your browser window or when you may like to scroll horizontally and vertically simultaneously.

In circumstances where it is not feasible to use the middle mouse button (because it will resize an image or you simply do not have a middle mouse button), the alt key can be used in its place. Simply press the alt key to grab the page and move your mouse to pan. To stop panning, release the alt key.
